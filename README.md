# Portfolio
This repository includes the code base for my portfolio website (www.vivian-pham.com). I created this webpage to reflect my own creativity and style choices. I created this webpage using ASP.NET MVC, utilizing HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Razor Syntax, JavaScript, and C# langauges. It is a culmination of almost all the skills I learned during my time at the Tech Academy. I hope to add features to this website in the future.

A challenge that this launching this portfolio provided me was to learn how to host this website on Azure using a domain name that I had already purchased for an existing website. I was able to research and learn new things such as publishing through Azure, mapping the host to the domain using DNS records, and linking the www domain with the naked domain.

Overall, I am proud of this website and what I am able to showcase in creating it. As I learn more and more I feel I get new ideas on how to update and improve this personal project.
